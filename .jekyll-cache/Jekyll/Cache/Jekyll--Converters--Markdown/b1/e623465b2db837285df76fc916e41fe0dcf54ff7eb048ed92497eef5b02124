<p style="text-align:justify">Designing high-performance and low-cost materials for sustainable energy harvesting and utilization is one of the prime challenges our society faces today. Our group at Georgia Tech uses quantum mechanical modelling and materials informatics to discover and design functional materials for these applications. We also work to develop and apply new computational methodologies which can provide cost-effective but accurate descriptions of materials with complex properties. Through these investigations, we seek to obtain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying energy harvesting and the chemical conversions of molecules at atomic-level, to reveal structure-property relationships and provide experimentally realizable design principles. Combined with automated fabrication, we aim to accelerate the discovery of materials with complex properties to solve time-sensitive problems involving green energy production and climate remediation.</p>
