<h2>Accelerating Materials Discovery with AI</h2>

Finding new materials to serve as the next generation catalysts, batteries, solar cells, superconductors or electronic devices can have a potentially transformative impact on our lives and society. Here, we seek to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning methods to accelerate the process of materials discovery and design far beyond what is possible using conventional simulation and screening algorithms.
