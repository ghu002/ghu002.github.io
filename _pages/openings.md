We currently have openings for new members to join the team. We are looking for candidates who are interested in developing and applying ab initio computational methods and materials informatics to design functional materials for energy-related applications. Candidates with proficiency in density functional theory (DFT), quantum Monte Carlo (QMC), machine learning (ML), and molecular dynamics (MD) are highly encouraged to apply. We also seek candidates with expertise in just one particular listed area but are interested in our research and have a passion to learn new skills. If you are not sure if your background would be a good fit for our group, feel free to contact Dr. Hu for further discussions.

<b>Postdocs:</b>
We are currently accepting postdocs to join the group. Please email Dr. Hu your CV (including a list of references) and some research areas in our group you may be interested in. Examples of previous work, papers and/or code will also be useful to include here. 

<b>Graduate Students:</b>
We are currently accepting graduate students (PhD and MS) to join the group. Prospective students who are not part of GT should first apply to a graduate program in College of Engineering, and send Dr. Hu an email. Please email your CV and some research areas in our group you may be interested in. Examples of previous work, papers and/or code will also be useful to include here.

<b>Undergraduate Students and Interns:</b>
We are currently accepting undergraduate students at GT to join the group for research course credits. Please email Dr. Hu your CV and some research areas in our group you may be interested in. Examples of previous work, papers and/or code will also be useful to include here.
